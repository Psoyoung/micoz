# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Base Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React.js 18 frontend and Node.js 18 backend structure following the technical requirements specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create a monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend directories
2. Frontend setup:
   - Initialize React 18 with TypeScript
   - Configure Styled-components for styling
   - Setup Redux Toolkit for state management
   - Configure React Router v6
   - Install Framer Motion for animations
3. Backend setup:
   - Initialize Node.js 18 with Express.js
   - Configure PostgreSQL connection with Prisma ORM
   - Setup basic JWT authentication structure
   - Configure AWS S3 connection for file storage
4. Setup development environment:
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Setup Git hooks with Husky
   - Create Docker configuration for development environment

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all dependencies are correctly installed and working
2. Ensure the development server starts without errors
3. Validate the connection between frontend and backend
4. Test database connection and basic CRUD operations
5. Verify AWS S3 connection for file uploads
